# HerbaGuide Machine Learning

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the result of scraping. The herbal plant image dataset that we have collected consists of 10 classes, with 100 images per class. The image dataset has been divided into a training set with a total of 800 images and a test set with a total of 200 images. Our herbal plant image dataset was obtained from GBIF, a comprehensive global biodiversity data platform.

### Classes
Currently, only 10 classes are selected for herbal classification in the application. ['Babadotan', 'Kumis Kucing', 'Bakung', 'Belimbing Wuluh', 'Bunga Tasbih', 'Lidah Buaya', 'Mimba', 'Sambiloto', 'Sereh Dapur', 'Sirih']

## Built With
